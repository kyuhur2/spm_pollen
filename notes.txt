- longer lag days; distributed lag may be better
- bias is introduced if you have longer moving average for temperature x mortality correlation
- temperature is a covariate; simplier model (not distributed lag model) may be fine
- limit the lag day for temperature (?)
- distribution of QAIC according to lag days of temperature [dependent var ~ independent var + confounding vars]
    - confounding vars should include same day temperature (e.g. 0) by default
    - confounding vars will include temperature (e.g. 7, 14, 21) = 20 may be too long at the moment
- trade-off between air pollution and temperature effect on mortality
- add "year" into the model for long-term trend (without spline, linear term is fine)
- may need "holiday" confounding variable when conducting sensitivity analysis
- results visualization (without pollen, with pollen)
- forest plots (city specific and combined) should be included in the supplementary materials
